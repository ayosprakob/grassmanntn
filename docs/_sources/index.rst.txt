GrassmannTN 1.4.0
=======================================
GrassmannTN is a python package that aims to simplify the coding involving Grassmann tensor network.
The goal is to make the coding as convenient as when you use other standard packages like numpy or scipy.
All the sign factors are computed automatically without explicit user inputs. If you have further questions about the package and how to use it, please contact me via ayosp-at-phys.sc.niigata-u.ac.jp

.. note::
	This documentation is still not fully complete. I plan to add the page describing minor functions, as well as a short tutorial for some simple examples. This should be done by the end of October. Sorry for the inconvenience. 

Package structure
-----------------
- `grassmanntn <grassmanntn/index.html>`_ (main module): contains most of the features.
- `grassmanntn.param <grassmanntn.param/index.html>`_: contains technical functions such as the sign factor :math:`\sigma_I`, the parity :math:`p(I)` or the encoder-switching function :math:`\varepsilon(I)`.
- `grassmann.arith <grassmanntn.arith/index.html>`_: a new module added in v 1.3.0 to help the user build the initial tensor directly from the fermionic action/Hamiltonian. Symbolic expression is supported.

Prerequisites
-------------
- `numpy <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html>`_
- `sparse <https://sparse.pydata.org/en/stable/>`_
- `opt_einsum <https://optimized-einsum.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_

Installation
-------------
Installation via PyPI

::
	
	pip install grassmanntn


Once the package is installed, download `example.py <https://github.com/ayosprakob/grassmanntn/blob/main/example.py>`_ and try running it with

::
	
	python3 example.py --show_progress

An example code of a one-flavor two-dimensional :math:`\mathbb{Z}_2` gauge theory should be able to run.
